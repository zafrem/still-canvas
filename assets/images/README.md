## Adding Your Own Images

To add your own images:

1. Place images in the appropriate category folder
2. Rename the image to `default.jpg` or `default.png`
3. The app will automatically try both .jpg and .png extensions
4. Recommended image dimensions: 800x600 to 1200x900 pixels
5. Supported formats: JPG, PNG

**Note:** The app tries .jpg first, then .png. You can have either format - no need to update code!

## Image Recommendations

### Landscape
- Natural scenes with varied tones (mountains, forests, seascapes)
- High dynamic range works best for interesting painting effects

### Meditation
- Calming, minimalist compositions
- Soft gradients and peaceful subjects

### Still Life
- Classic still life compositions
- Good contrast between light and shadow areas

### Photography
- Any photographic art
- Portraits, abstract, or artistic photography
